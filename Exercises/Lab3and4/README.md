FiniteFunctions 
    Added ingtegral calculator
    Added metropolis algorithm

ChildFunctions -  Children of Finite Functions that take different inputs to produce different distrobutions
    Normal class - Mystery data distrobution
    Cauchy Lorentz class
    Crystal Ball Class

ReadWrite
    A series of functions from assignment 1 that read and write data

Makefile should compile all of the required files using make

When the executable TestFiniteFunctions has run, it will display the functions along with the metropolis data in the Outputs/png folder and the metropolis data will also get written into the Outputs/data folder.
